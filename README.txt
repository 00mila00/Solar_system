# Solar_system

This program is my graphic visualisation of Solar System with accurate oribits, rotations and textures.
To accomplish my task i needed to add cone (i added it as a moon)

What you can do in this app:
> change speed of planets rotation
> rotate current scene
> thicken or thinning out cone mesh
> moving around the scene (by mouse)
> see meshes in wireframe mode

See added screenshots to see how it looks :)
